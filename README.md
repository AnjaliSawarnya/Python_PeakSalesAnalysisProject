# Python_PeakSalesAnalysisProject
Data Analysis and Visualisation (Python): Used pandas, matplotlib, seaborn to analyse and visualise customer's data for KPI's to be considered in next Peak season.
I have imported "Diwali Sales Data.csv" as the data source and am attaching the raw file here also, to be loaded into jupyter notebook and used for analysis.
I did Data Wrangling & Data Cleaning, explored the data by grouping and assessing useful data.
I am also sharing the codes for the assessment, to get the visual representations.
